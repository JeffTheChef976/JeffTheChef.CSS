### This is my personal github repository, where I store all of my personal CSS snippets and additions for my modded Discord client.

> As of now, there are three seperate css files, <ins>jeffthechef.css</ins>, <ins>acrylic.css</ins>, and <ins>extra.css</ins> 

### Here is the guide to what is in those files.
> <ins>jeffthechef.css</ins> | The main css file you will probably need, it has all of the core additions to my discord client.

> <ins>acrylic.css</ins> | This css file contains snippets that make some elements acrylic/transparent.

> <ins>extra.css</ins> | These are css snippets that you will paste into your QuickCSS on Discord.
