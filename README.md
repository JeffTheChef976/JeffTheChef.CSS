### This is my personal github repository, where I store all of my personal CSS snippets and additions for my modded Discord client.

> As of now, there are three seperate css files, `jeffthechef.css`, `acrylic.css`, and `extra.css`

### <ins>Here is the guide to what is in those css files</ins>.
> `jeffthechef.css` | The main css file you will probably need, it has all of the core additions to my discord client.

> `acrylic.css` | This css file contains snippets that make some elements acrylic/transparent.

> `extra.css` | These are css snippets that you will paste into your QuickCSS on Discord.
