This is my personal github repository, where I store all of my personal CSS snippets and additions for Discord.

There are three seperate css files, jeffthechef.css, acrylic.css, and extra.css [Refer to image.]

jeffthechef.css | The main css file you will probably need, it has all of the core additions to my discord client.

acrylic.css | This css file contains snippets that make some elements acrylic/transparent.

extra.css | These are css snippets that you will paste into your QuickCSS on Discord.
